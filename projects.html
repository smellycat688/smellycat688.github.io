<h2><a href="https://vimeo.com/781070442">Documentary</a>
</h2>
<p>In my documentary, The Commuter Experience, I highlight how students at Fordham University who commute to school every day from their homes feel "displaced" since they have difficulty participating in school activities and activities because of their commutes. Even though Fordham University tries its best to accommodate the needs of off-campus students, it still falls short on several fronts in its ability to adequately meet those needs. We created this short film to document commuter struggles and to determine if Fordham has a sense of community for commuters. By conducting observational methods and interviews, we gained a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Four commuter students were interviewed to learn about their daily commute to and from school. To demonstrate just how Fordham accommodates the needs of commuter students, we shot some B-roll at one of CSA's (Commuter Student Association's) monthly meetings in order to show them just how accommodating the university is. Apart from the B-roll footage mentioned above, we also took some B-roll footage of the campus, both inside and outside, as well as some shots of some of the most famous landmarks in the city, such as Columbus Circle. The purpose of this video was to provide an overview of Fordham's services to the viewer in a manner that will convey to them the value that Fordham brings. Generally, this documentary was created to capture the visual expressions of students, whether they were positive or negative, to help them communicate their concerns about being a commuter effectively, if needed.
